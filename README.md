#### Inspiration: 
As an avid fan of online shopping, I found it surprising that many luxury brands had online websites, but did not have an app version. 
Because of this, I wanted to create a simple app that users can use for shopping at there favorite online store, even if they do not have an app! 

#### Mutabiliy: 
If you would like to replicate this code, please credit me! In order to create this app, I realied on the WebKit UI element provided for Swift and SwiftUI. 
The code is super simple and works for any store, simply replace the URL link provided in the ContentView.swift file with your desirable web url.
